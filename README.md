# FEMSA Digital House Challenge

This is a redeem points app done in React Native and Typescript with Expo.

## How to run

1. Before starting, download Expo Go app from Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS).
2. After cloning this repository, we'll need to install the project's dependencies, just run `yarn` on root directory.
3. Once finished, run `yarn expo` to start the local bundler of the application.
4. Since this is an Expo app once the bundler is ready you'll see a QR code printed on the terminal. Scan the QR code above with the Expo Go app (Android) or the Camera app (iOS) in your smartphone to see the app in action.

All done! You will now have the application up and running on your mobile device.
